# VMware CodeHouse 2021

This project will serve as guidance for attendees and mentors of VMware CodeHouse 2021.

The goal of VMware CodeHouse 2021 will be to create an application that furthers STEM eduction and/or Diversity & Inclusion.

This project contains several small chapters, with each chapter adds bit-sized concepts to the last one. The end product is a TODO web application written in Go, Gin and Vue. The end product has two main parts:
- **Server side** -  a Rest API written in Go (the base language) and Gin (a web framework for Go).
- **Client side** -  a Javascript application running in the browser that interacts with the API. Vue is the client-side Javascript framework.
